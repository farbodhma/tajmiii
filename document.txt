how file work:

there is a file that named groups.json
in this file you gonna have "user_phone_number":"full_storage_file_path" for all users
and you can find that full data from that user storaged in which file in "users" folder

this gonna make your Order better

because you dont need to check all users for finding or editing or adding new user
and it's can also handle a lot of datas

there is a $userFileLimit in index.php file that you can customize it at first and it's
gonna set that how many users data gonna storage on any file in users folder
but you can just edit this at first, and after storage any it's cant edit anymore
